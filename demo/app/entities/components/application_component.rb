# The base class for every component in this application.
#
# A component is an ordinary ActiveRecord model that owns one table and belongs
# to exactly one entity. It may hold behaviour as well as data, and it must
# never reference an entity subclass.
#
# Generate one with:
#
#   rails g ecs_rails:component Email address:string verified:boolean
#
# See docs/architecture.md §1.
class ApplicationComponent < EcsRails::Component
