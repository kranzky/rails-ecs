# Exercises RFC-0005: method delegation from an entity to its components.
#
# This is where the proposal's headline sugar becomes real:
#
#   user.send_welcome_email   # => user.email.send_welcome_email
#   user.address = "a@b.com"  # => user.email.address = "a@b.com"
#
# The governing rule is ADR-0004: two components exposing the same name is a
# DelegationConflict raised at *declaration* time, never a silent last-wins.
#
# Throwaway entity classes are stub_const'd, never anonymous: the registry keys
# by class name (RFC-0002 / RFC-0004), so an anonymous entity cannot declare
# components at all. This is the tax the RFC's Notes call out.

  # Start each example with an empty registry so the throwaway classes below are
  # the only declarations. spec_helper's global after-hook restores the
  # models.rb baseline once we're done, so this clear cannot leak to another
  # file — that seal is central now, not this file's responsibility.
