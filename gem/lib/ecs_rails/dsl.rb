module EcsRails
  # The class-level DSL that composes an entity out of components.
  #
  # Implements RFC-0004. Extended into EcsRails::Entity, so every entity class —
  # and every subclass of one — answers `component`.
  #
  #   class User < ApplicationEntity
  #     component Name
  #     component Email
  #     component Group, except: [:title]
  #   end
  #
  #   User.components            # => [Name, Email, Group]
  #   User.create!.email         # => the Email row, or a virtual one (RFC-0006)
  #
  # Each declaration does three things: it records itself in the registry
  # (RFC-0002), it sets up the has_one that reads the component row, and it
  # generates the lazy reader (RFC-0006) into #generated_component_methods —
  # the module RFC-0005's delegated methods also land in.
  module DSL
    # Declares that this entity is composed from `component_class`.
    #
    # Defines a reader named for the component's model_name.singular, so
    # `component Email` gives `#email`.
    #
    # **The reader always returns an instance, never nil** (architecture.md §3).
    # If the entity has no row for the component, a virtual one is built with
    # every attribute at its default. That is RFC-0006's doing, layered on top of
    # this RFC through #generated_component_methods rather than woven into it —
    # see #define_component_reader.
    #
    # `only:` / `except:` restrict which of the component's methods are delegated
    # onto the entity (RFC-0005). They never affect the reader: `user.group`
    # exists whatever `except:` says. RFC-0004 validates and records them;
    # RFC-0005 acts on them.
    #
    # Deliberately no `dependent:` option on the has_one, contradicting RFC-0004
    # and matching architecture.md §3 and RFC-0003: cascade is owned by the
    # database. Every component table has an ON DELETE CASCADE FK to
    # entities(id), so entity.destroy already removes the rows, without loading a
    # single component. Declaring dependent: :destroy as well would put two
    # layers on one job — the ActiveRecord one masking the database one, so that
    # dropping the FK would break the invariant with every test still passing.
    # The price is that a component's own destroy callbacks do not run on
    # entity.destroy; that is a real gap, and it wants an ADR rather than a
    # has_one option.
    #
    # Raises InvalidComponent unless `component_class` is a concrete
    # EcsRails::Component; DuplicateComponent if this entity — or any entity it
    # inherits from — already declares it; ArgumentError for bad options or for
    # an anonymous class on either side.

    # subtle enough to want pinning by tests now rather than in RFC-0006.
    #
    # ADR-0004 requires generated methods to live in an included module rather
    # than on the class, so that a method defined on the entity itself wins by

    # the has_one reader (the seam RFC-0006 needs) rather than be shadowed by it.
    #
    # It holds for free. ActiveRecord's `inherited` hook calls
    # initialize_generated_modules, which creates and includes
    # GeneratedAssociationMethods at class-definition time — long before any

    #   - instance_methods(false) misses methods gained from included modules
    #     (Name#initials comes from Nameable) and misses attribute accessors.
    #   - instance_methods minus EcsRails::Component's picks up module methods,
    #     but once ActiveRecord has lazily generated a component's attribute
    #     methods it also drags in every dirty-tracking helper — address_was,
    #     address_changed?, saved_change_to_address?, and a hundred more.
    #
    # So behaviour and attributes are computed separately and unioned:

    #                ancestors define, minus the AR-generated attribute module
