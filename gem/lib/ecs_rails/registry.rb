module EcsRails
  # Records which components each entity declares. See RFC-0002.
  #
  # The registry is a process-wide singleton (`EcsRails.registry`) populated by the
  # `component` DSL (RFC-0004) at class-load time, and read by generators,
  # delegation and — later — systems.
  #
  # Reload safety is the whole design constraint. In development Rails does not
  # mutate a reloaded class in place: it removes the constant and autoloads a
  # brand-new Class object under the same name. A registry that held class
  # objects would pin the old, orphaned constants forever, and every lookup
  # would hand back classes the rest of the app has already forgotten. So
  # nothing here stores a Class: entries are keyed by class *name*, and names are
  # resolved back to live constants via #constantize at read time.
  class Registry
    # One `component Foo` declaration on one entity class.
    #
    # A value object over *names*. #entity_class / #component_class resolve on
    # every call, so a Declaration handed out before a reload still resolves to
    # the post-reload constants.
